# CXR

A chest X-Ray learning app.

## Note

[Data limitations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data):

> "The image labels are NLP (natural language processing) extracted so there could be some erroneous labels but the NLP labelling accuracy is estimated to be >90%."

As the interpretation of the data is not 100% accurate, there could be cases of incorrect data, such as inaccurately labelled chest X-rays, false positives, false negatives, correctly labeling but missing other diseases in the labeling, etc.

## Warning

This app is for educational purposes only.
Do not make medical decisions or diagnoses based on the images or information in this app.
Always seek advice from a qualified healthcare professional.

## Changes in the app

The original data included cases that weren't labelled with any lung diseases; these were removed in the app. All chest X-ray images shown in the app have at least one lung disease labelled.

Result: 50,000+ chest X-ray images from 30,000+ unique patients.
